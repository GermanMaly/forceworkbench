# The values public/forceworkbench and private/forceworkbench are just examples.
# The idea is that the public/forceworkbench would be something on Docker Hub somewhere
# and would mirror what is in the public GitHub repo. The private/forceworkbench might be somewhere
# like ECR or other private image registry. Note that Dockerfile.customizations contains
# `FROM public/forceworkbench` so that inherits from `public/forceworkbench` and
# just adds additional files as additional layers on top of the public image. This is all shown in
# one repo here, but in practice, these two Dockerfiles and additional config files might be
# in separate GitHub repos. This approach can work for non-secret config, but it is not recommened
# for true secrets. They should be injected either via the environment or volume mounts.

docker build -f Dockerfile -t public/forceworkbench .

docker build -f Dockerfile.customizations -t private/forceworkbench .
